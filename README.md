# TMUX Script Creator

Hello! Welcome to the Tmux's script creator.
This script will help you to create a script for tmux easily. (Hopefully!)

Follow these steps:

1. Enter the session name in the upper left corner (required).
2. By default you have one window with one pane, you can add as much windows as needed pressing the big button.
3. To change the layout of each window you can use the dropdown list right below where you typed the session name.
(for the time being the layouts are limited by the ones in the dropdown, hope to add more in the future; or even better, to make the layout to be dynamically created)
4. To add a command to the pane, just type it inside the pane. Each command should be separated by a new line.
5. After adding all of the commands, press the button below to get the script in this box. You can now copy and paste it in your .sh file!

Hope you find it useful!
