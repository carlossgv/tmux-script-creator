  'This script will help you to create a script for tmux easily. (Hopefully!)\n\n' +
  'Follow these steps:\n\n' +
  '1. Enter the session name in the upper left corner (required).\n' +
  '2. By default you have one window with one pane, you can add as much windows as needed pressing the big button.\n' +
  '3. To change the layout of each window you can use the dropdown list right below where you typed the session name.\n' +
  '(for the time being the layouts are limited by the ones in the dropdown, hope to add more in the future; or even better, to make the layout to be dynamically created)\n' +
  '4. To add a command to the pane, just type it inside the pane. Each command should be separated by a new line.\n' +
  '5. After adding all of the commands, press the button below to get the script in this box. You can now copy and paste it in your .sh file!\n' +
